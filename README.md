# UCL-IHI-Hackathon 2020 + 1

##This is a backup Github for Backend.

## Welcome!

The IHI Code Club Hackathon 2020+1 is a full-day collaborative hacking sprint to solve real-world issues in health data science. As participant, you will have a unique opportunity to learn from and collaborate with other participants from diverse backgrounds including students, researchers, data scientists, software engineers, and public.

We were tasked with tackling a public health problem using public data sets and we tackled the problem of air quality and respiratory illness in the US.

### How to use this application 

This uses [streamlit](streamlit.io) as a framework for the dashboard and heroku is the cloud platform used for hosting it. 

To use streamlit, you can run the following code from the command line: 

`pip install streamlit`

and when you want to run the application locally, use: 

`streamlit run [filename].py`

Just make sure you have all of the relevant modules installed in the python script otherwise you'll run into errors! You can find the requirements needed in the requirements.txt file. 

### The Datasets 

We've used a variety of data sets. You can find them below: 

* [US Respiratory illnesses 1980-2014](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-chronic-respiratory-disease-mortality-rates-county-1980-2014)
* [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
* [Air Quality Index](https://aqicn.org/map/world/) (for a future attempt if done)
